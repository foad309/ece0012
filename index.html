               <p> 1. &nbsp;    The study of Computer Architecture and Organization helps to know the execution of computer instruction at the micro level.
<br>
<br>
                2. &nbsp;    Data flow, memory hierarchy, tradeoffs and timing analysis can be known by studying Computer Architecture and Organization.
<br>
<br>
                3.  &nbsp;   The concepts of embedded systems, processor design can be also known. 
    <br>   
                4.  &nbsp;   Helps to write assembly code, real-time code or time critical systems coding.
<br>
<br>
                5.  &nbsp;   Memory hierarchy model, RAM, ROM, use of ‘pipeline’ can be known exactly by Computer Architecture and Organization.
<br>
<br>
                6. &nbsp;    It gives fundamental and basic understandings about how computer works.
<br>
<br>
                7.   &nabla;  Many things depends on Computer Architecture and Organization understanding like – performance analysis, practical software, parallel software, embedded systems, game programming, databases, accelerators, GPGPU computing, compiler optimization etc.
<br>
<br>
                8.   &nabla;  Its knowledge helps to write programs faster, smaller, less prone to error.
<br>
<br>
                9.   &nabla;  It also helps program debugging.
<br>
<br>
                10. &nabla;  It gives idea about relative cost of computer operation, the relation of software and users by their inner workings.
